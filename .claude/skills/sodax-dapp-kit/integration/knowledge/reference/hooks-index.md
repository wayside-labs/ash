# Hooks index — `@sodax/dapp-kit` v2

Comprehensive hook table across 12 feature domains. Use this when you know the feature you're building but don't remember the exact hook name.

## Provider + context

| Hook | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SodaxProvider` | Component | Wraps app; provides `Sodax` instance + RPC config |
| `createSodaxQueryClient` | Factory | Returns `QueryClient` with global mutation observability |
| `useSodaxContext` | Utility | Access the `Sodax` SDK instance |
| `useHubProvider` | Utility | Hub chain (Sonic) provider |

## Swap

| Hook | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `useQuote` | Query | Real-time swap quote (auto-refreshes 3s) |
| `useSwap` | Mutation | Execute a complete cross-chain swap |
| `useSwapAllowance` | Query | Check token approval status |
| `useSwapApprove` | Mutation | Approve tokens for the swap contract |
| `useStatus` | Query | Track intent execution status (polls 3s once `intentTxHash` supplied; stops on `3`/`4` and after 40 consecutive NOT_FOUND fetches; Result-wrapped data) |

## Swaps API (`sodax.api.swaps`)

Typed React Query wrappers over the backend Swaps API (`sodax.api.swaps.*`), one per endpoint. Distinct from the on-chain `swap/` hooks (`useQuote`/`useStatus`/`useSwap`/…), which drive `sodax.swaps` (the `SwapService`).

### Tokens · quote · fees · gas (reads)

|---|---|
| `useSwapsApiTokens` | Query; all supported swap tokens by chain |
| `useSwapsApiTokensByChain` | Query; tokens for one chain |

## Bridge API (`sodax.api.bridge`)

Typed React Query wrappers over the backend Bridge API (`sodax.api.bridge.*`). Distinct from the on-chain `bridge/` hooks (`useBridge`/`useBridgeAllowance`/…), which drive `sodax.bridge` (the `BridgeService`). Smaller than the swaps family (no intent/solver surface). The fee / bridgeable-amount / bridgeable quotes are computable client-side (prefer the on-chain `useGetBridgeableAmount` / `sodax.bridge.*` — no round-trip), but are also mirrored here as HTTP hooks for parity.

| Hook | Type / Polling |
|---|---|
| `useBridgeApiTokens` | Query; all supported bridge tokens by chain |
| `useBridgeApiTokensByChain` | Query; supported bridge tokens for one `chainKey` |
| `useBridgeApiAllowance` | Query; `{ valid }` allowance check (wire-named body) |

| `useBridgeApiBridgeableAmount` | Query; `{ limit }` deposit capacity / withdrawal liquidity for a pair |
| `useBridgeApiIsBridgeable` | Query; `{ bridgeable }` whether a (from, to) pair is bridgeable |
| `useBridgeApiSubmitTxStatus` | Query (1s); requires `txHash` + `srcChainKey`; polls until `executed` / `failed` / `abandonedAt`, or the backend rejects the API key |
| `useBridgeApiApprove` | Mutation; builds the unsigned approval txs — `{ tx, resetTx? }`, ordering is yours to handle |
| `useBridgeApiApproveAndBroadcast` | Mutation; builds **and** signs/broadcasts/waits — preferred; `{ approveTxHash, resetTxHash? }`; optional `onProgress` per step |
| `useBridgeApiCreateBridgeIntent` | Mutation; builds `{ tx, relayData }` (no intent) |
| `useBridgeApiSubmitTx` | Mutation; `request: BridgeSubmitTxRequestV2` (FULL relayData envelope) |

## Leverage Yield API (`sodax.api.leverageYield`)

Typed React Query wrappers over the backend Leverage Yield API (`sodax.api.leverageYield.*`), one per endpoint. Distinct from the on-chain `leverageYield/` hooks (`useLeverageYieldDeposit`/`useLeverageYieldWithdraw`/…), which drive `sodax.leverageYield` (the `LeverageYieldService`). A vault deposit/withdraw IS an intent-based swap, so the intent / gas / fee / submit-tx hooks mirror the swaps family; the vault registry, vault reads and the split deposit/withdraw quote + create-intent hooks are leverage-yield's own.

| Hook | Type / Polling |

| `useLeverageYieldApiTotalAssets` | Query; total assets under management |
| `useLeverageYieldApiPreviewDeposit` | Query; ERC-4626 `previewDeposit` — shares for `assets` |

| `useLeverageYieldApiPreviewRedeem` | Query; ERC-4626 `previewRedeem` — assets for `shares` |
| `useLeverageYieldApiShareBalance` | Query; an owner's lsoda* balance (the HUB wallet, not the EOA) |
| `useLeverageYieldApiMaxWithdraw` | Query; RAW ERC-4626 `maxWithdraw` in ASSET units, NOT dust-trimmed — never a withdraw's `inputAmount`, which is shares; size a MAX withdraw from `useLeverageYieldApiShareBalance` |
| `useLeverageYieldApiDepositQuote` | Query; any token → lsoda* (set `query.includeTxData` for `txData`) |
| `useLeverageYieldApiWithdrawQuote` | Query; lsoda* → any token |
| `useLeverageYieldApiDeadline` | Query; computed vault-swap deadline |

| `useLeverageYieldApiPartnerFee` | Query; partner fee for an amount |
| `useLeverageYieldApiSolverFee` | Query; protocol (solver) fee for an amount |
| `useLeverageYieldApiSubmitTxStatus` | Query (1s); requires `txHash` + `srcChainKey`; polls until `solved` / `failed` / `abandonedAt` |
| `useLeverageYieldApiApprove` | Mutation; builds unsigned approval tx(s) — `{ tx, resetTx? }`, ordering is yours to handle |
| `useLeverageYieldApiApproveAndBroadcast` | Mutation; builds **and** signs/broadcasts/waits — preferred; `{ approveTxHash, resetTxHash? }`; optional `onProgress` per step |
| `useLeverageYieldApiCreateDepositIntent` | Mutation; builds `{ tx, intent, relayData }` (any token → lsoda*) |
| `useLeverageYieldApiCreateWithdrawIntent` | Mutation; builds `{ tx, intent, relayData }` (lsoda* → any token) |
| `useLeverageYieldApiSubmitIntent` | Mutation; submits broadcast intent to the relay |
| `useLeverageYieldApiCancelIntent` | Mutation; builds unsigned cancel tx |
| `useLeverageYieldApiSubmitTx` | Mutation; `request: LeverageYieldSubmitTxRequestV2` — the swaps body PLUS a required `operation: 'deposit' \| 'withdraw'` |

## Sponsoring (`sponsoring/`)

Stellar accounts must exist on-chain before they can hold or receive anything, and a new user holds 0 XLM.
These hooks drive the sponsored-reserve activation flow, where the SODAX sponsor pays the base reserve.
