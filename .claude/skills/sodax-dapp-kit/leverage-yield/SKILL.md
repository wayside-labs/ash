# Leverage Yield (dapp-kit granular skill)

Granular skill for the leverage-yield hooks of `@sodax/dapp-kit` v2. queryKey/mutationKey first segment: `leverageYield`. React-only — backend uses `@sodax/sdk` directly. **New in v2; no v1 migration path.**

## Step 1 — Clarify with user before coding

0. **Vault or leverage position?** Ask first — they share the `leverageYield` key namespace and nothing else. A **vault** is one pooled ERC-4626 position at a single target LTV (`useLeverageYield*`). A **leverage position** is the user's own AAVE account, cloned per position (`useLeveragePosition*`, `useOpenLeveragePosition`). `useLeverageYieldPosition` is the **vault's** snapshot — it is not a leverage position. If the answer is positions, jump to Step 1b.
1. **Deposit or withdraw?** Deposit = any token → `lsoda*` shares (lands in the hub wallet). Withdraw = `lsoda*` shares → any token on any chain.
2. **Build vs execute.** `useLeverageYieldDeposit` / `useLeverageYieldWithdraw` only *build* a `LeverageYieldSwapPayload`; `useLeverageYieldVaultSwap` *executes* it (create → relay → notify solver). You always need both.
3. **Approval?** Deposit approves the spoke `inputToken` via the swap-domain `useSwapApprove` / `useSwapAllowance` (no leverage-yield-specific approve hook). Withdraw needs no approval (`hubWalletSwap: true`).
4. **Which reads?** `useLeverageYieldEffectiveApr` (headline APR), `useLeverageYieldPosition` (LTV/health), `useLeverageYieldTotalAssets` (TVL), `useLeverageYieldPreviewRedeem` (price-per-share), `useLeverageYieldShareBalances` (per-chain balances — returns an array).

### Step 1b — leverage positions

1. **Which mutation?** Decided by the operation, not by preference. Open → `useOpenLeveragePosition`. Leverage change (`buildAddLeverage` / `buildDecreaseLeverage`) → `useSubmitLeveragePositionIntent`. Withdraw / settle / cancel → `useRunLeveragePositionOperation`. The first two report the intent; the third has nothing to report, and routing a leverage change through it leaves an intent nothing will fill. TypeScript enforces this via the `PositionIntentCall` / `PositionDirectCall` brands.
2. **Approval?** Gate on `useLeveragePositionFundingAllowance`, approve with `useApproveLeveragePositionFunding` — the spender differs per chain and the SDK resolves it. Nothing is ever approved to the factory.
3. **Sized the leg?** `borrowAmount` / `minCollateralOut` come from `sizeLeverageBorrow` → `getPositionLegQuote` → `projectLeverageLeg`, never oracle parity. Read `ltv` / `liquidationThreshold` from `useEModes` when the position sets an `eModeCategory`.
4. **Which reads?** `useLeveragePositions` / `useLeveragePositionsForUser` (discovery), `useLeveragePositionAccount` (health/LTV), `useLeveragePositionCollateral` (sizes an exit), `useLeveragePositionPending` (is an intent live), `useLeveragePositionInfo` (this position's own `feeBps`), `useLeveragePositionPayoutAddress` (where a withdrawal can pay — **not a query**, returns synchronously).

## Integration workflow (new v2 code)

1. [`../integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](../integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DO NOT (read first).
2. [`../integration/knowledge/architecture.md`](../integration/knowledge/architecture.md) — hook shapes, `mutateAsyncSafe`, `unwrapResult`, queryKey conventions.
3. [`../integration/knowledge/features/leverage-yield.md`](../integration/knowledge/features/leverage-yield.md) — full hook surface, mutation TVars, read shapes, approval pattern, gotchas.
4. [`../integration/knowledge/recipes/leverage-yield.md`](../integration/knowledge/recipes/leverage-yield.md) — full worked examples (deposit, withdraw, stats, share balances).
5. Call-shape choice → [`../integration/knowledge/recipes/mutation-error-handling.md`](../integration/knowledge/recipes/mutation-error-handling.md).

### Leverage-yield-specific anti-patterns (dapp-kit)

- **Calling `useLeverageYieldDeposit` / `useLeverageYieldWithdraw` and expecting a tx.** They are builders — their `data` is a `LeverageYieldSwapPayload`. Spread it into `useLeverageYieldVaultSwap`'s `mutate` with a `walletProvider` to broadcast.
- **Treating `useLeverageYieldShareBalances` as a single query.** It returns an **array** (one `useQueries` row per holder). Aggregate with `reduce`; the key segment is singular `shareBalance`.
- **Gating withdraw on an allowance check.** Withdraw carries `hubWalletSwap: true` — the hub wallet authorises the share spend via `sendMessage`. Only `deposit` uses `useSwapAllowance` / `useSwapApprove`.
- **Reaching for a `useLeverageYieldApprove` hook.** It doesn't exist — the deposit approves the spoke asset manager, so use the swap-domain hooks.
- **Quoting a vault flow with `useQuote`, or with a different fee.** Size `minOutputAmount` with `useLeverageYieldQuote` on the **gross** `inputAmount` — it deducts the effective leverage-yield fee itself, so netting the amount first deducts it twice. Pass it the same `partnerFee` as `useLeverageYieldDeposit` / `useLeverageYieldWithdraw`, or omit it on both. `useQuote` deducts the *swap* fee instead, and whenever the two fees differ the derived `minOutputAmount` can be unfillable.

### Leverage-position anti-patterns (dapp-kit)

- **Reading `useLeverageYieldPosition` for a leverage position.** That is the **vault's** snapshot. A leverage position's live account is `useLeveragePositionAccount`.
- **Treating a resolved `useOpenLeveragePosition` as an open position.** It resolves when the intent is LIVE. The hook unwraps the SDK `Result`, so check **`result.notified`** on `mutateAsync`'s value (not `result.value.notified`); `false` means nothing will fill it before it expires. Do not retry on it — that opens a second position.
- **Routing a leverage change through `useRunLeveragePositionOperation`.** It does not notify. Leverage changes go through `useSubmitLeveragePositionIntent`; the brands refuse the mistake at compile time, so never cast past them.
- **Calling `notifySolver` yourself after `useSubmitLeveragePositionIntent`.** The hook already reports the intent — read `notified` on its result instead.
- **Awaiting `useLeveragePositionPayoutAddress` like a query.** It is synchronous: `Address | undefined`, no `data` / `isLoading`. Off the hub a withdrawal pays to a hub address that is **not** the signer, which is exactly what it resolves.
- **Sizing an exit from `totalCollateralBase`.** Display-only. Use `useLeveragePositionCollateral` — an over-sized `decreaseLeverage` reverts at fill time and the intent silently expires.
- **Charging an existing position the configured fee.** Read `feeBps` from `useLeveragePositionInfo`; `getEffectivePositionFee()` is what a NEW position would carry.
- **Treating the mutation receipt as completion.** A solver fills a leverage change afterwards — poll `useLeveragePositionPending`.

## Verification

1. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` clean.
2. Deposit/withdraw build a payload, then `useLeverageYieldVaultSwap` executes it (`{ ...payload, walletProvider }`).
3. `useLeverageYieldShareBalances` consumers treat `data` as an array and aggregate.
4. Withdraw flows do not gate on `useSwapAllowance`.
5. Mutation flows use `mutateAsyncSafe` and branch on `result.ok`; reads read `data` directly (no `.ok`/`.value`), except `useLeverageYieldQuote` and `useLeverageYieldDetailedStatus`, whose `data` is the SDK `Result` (branch on `data?.ok`).
6. Positions: leverage changes use `useSubmitLeveragePositionIntent` (never `useRunLeveragePositionOperation`), `notified` is checked on every open and leverage change, and exits are sized from `useLeveragePositionCollateral` with the fee from `useLeveragePositionInfo`.
7. Positions: funding is gated on `useLeveragePositionFundingAllowance` + `useApproveLeveragePositionFunding`, and `borrowAmount` / `minCollateralOut` trace back to `sizeLeverageBorrow` + `projectLeverageLeg`.

## Related granular skills (same family)

- [`../swap/SKILL.md`](../swap/SKILL.md) — `useSwapApprove` / `useSwapAllowance` (spoke-side deposit approval) live here. Size `minOutputAmount` with `useLeverageYieldQuote`, not the swap skill's `useQuote`.
- [`../auxiliary-services/SKILL.md`](../auxiliary-services/SKILL.md) — `useXBalances` / gas-estimation utilities used alongside leverage-yield UI.

For multi-feature tasks, load the broad [`sodax-dapp-kit` skill](../SKILL.md).

## Wallet connectivity (different SDK package family)

`walletProvider` flows through `mutate(vars)`. **Also load the `sodax-wallet-sdk-react` skill (integration mode)** to wire wallets and get a typed `walletProvider` via `useWalletProvider({ xChainId: chainKey })`.
