description: 'Sign and broadcast SODAX transactions from a backend, script, CI, bot, or non-React app with @sodax/wallet-sdk-core — one wallet-provider class per chain family (EVM, Solana, Sui, Bitcoin, Stellar, ICON, Injective, NEAR, Stacks). INTEGRATION (write NEW code) — the low-level multi-chain wallet layer (one provider class per chain family across 9 chain types). Each class accepts either a private-key config (Node scripts, CI, bots, indexers) or a browser-extension config (custom non-React browser flows) and signs + broadcasts transactions. Use whenever a backend, script, test, or non-React browser flow needs to instantiate a wallet provider directly — `EvmWalletProvider`, `SolanaWalletProvider`, etc. Triggers on "instantiate EvmWalletProvider", "sign a tx from a Node script", "wallet provider for backend", "private-key signing", "wallet-sdk-core setup", any `*WalletProvider` class name. For React dapps prefer `sodax-wallet-sdk-react` instead — most React consumers never touch this package directly and get a typed `IXxxWalletProvider` via `useWalletProvider(...)`. MIGRATION (port v1 → v2) — v1 → v2 changes are additive (same class names, same config-type names, same config shapes). The only mechanical migration is replacing deep imports from v1''s flat `wallet-providers/<chain>.ts` layout with barrel imports, plus optionally adopting the new `defaults` field and re-imported library types. Triggers on imports from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/…`, bumping from an older RC, or adopting new additive `defaults` / `*WalletDefaults` / `*Policy` fields. Most projects don''t need a wallet-sdk-core migration — the real migration target is usually `@sodax/sdk` or `@sodax/types`. Load this skill if EITHER applies; the body gates by mode.'

# When to use this skill

AGENTS.md routes you here when you're working with `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` v2 — either writing new code or upgrading an older project.

**Pick your mode:**

- Writing NEW v2 code (greenfield wallet provider setup, no v1 deep imports)? → § **Integration mode** below.
- Upgrading EXISTING code (deep imports from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/…`, bumping from an older RC)? → § **Migration mode** below. **Headline: v1 code drops in unchanged at the wallet-sdk-core surface** — if compile errors appear here, the real migration target is almost certainly `@sodax/sdk` or `@sodax/types` (load `sodax-sdk` skill instead).

For React consumers → use `sodax-wallet-sdk-react` (they get the typed wallet provider via `useWalletProvider(...)` and pass it to `@sodax/sdk` calls).

---

## Integration mode (writing new v2 code)

Direct usage of `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` is the right choice for:

- Backend / Node scripts (CI tests, indexers, bots, server APIs).
- Custom browser flows that don't use React.
- Tests that need to sign with a deterministic key.

### Workflow

1. Read [`integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](./integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DON'T + workflow + stop conditions.
2. Read [`integration/knowledge/architecture.md`](./integration/knowledge/architecture.md) — mental model: `BaseWalletProvider`, dual-config discriminants (Bitcoin/Stellar via an explicit `type` field, every other chain via field presence), shallow `defaults` merge, library-exports.
3. Read [`integration/knowledge/quickstart.md`](./integration/knowledge/quickstart.md) — copy-paste minimal example for the chain you need.
4. For your chain, read [`integration/knowledge/features/`](./integration/knowledge/features/) — per-chain config table + methods + gotchas (one file per chain family).
5. Task-specific recipes → [`integration/knowledge/recipes/`](./integration/knowledge/recipes/) — `setup-private-key.md`, `setup-browser-extension.md`, `sign-and-broadcast.md`, `defaults-and-overrides.md`, `library-exports.md`, `bridge-to-sdk.md` (pass provider to `@sodax/sdk`).
6. Lookups → [`integration/knowledge/reference/`](./integration/knowledge/reference/) — public API, provider classes, interfaces (`IXxxWalletProvider`), chain support, glossary.

### Conventions to follow (integration)

- **Dual-config discriminant.** **Bitcoin and Stellar** configs carry an explicit `type` discriminator (`'PRIVATE_KEY'` for Node / scripts or `'BROWSER_EXTENSION'` for consumer dApps); **every other chain** (EVM, Solana, Sui, ICON, Injective, NEAR, Stacks) discriminates by field presence (e.g. `privateKey` vs `walletClient`/`wallet`). Either way, pick ONE variant — don't merge them.
- **`defaults` is a shallow merge.** Each provider accepts a `defaults` field for per-method overrides (e.g. `waitForTransactionReceipt`, `gasPrice`). The merge into the per-call options is **shallow**, not deep. Top-level keys overwrite wholesale.
- **Use barrel imports**, not deep imports. Import classes from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`, not from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/<chain>.ts`.
- **Re-import chain SDK types from the barrel.** `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` re-exports the types you need (e.g. `WalletClient` from viem, `SuiClient` from `@mysten/sui`). Don't add the underlying SDK as a direct dep — risks version skew.
- **`IXxxWalletProvider` is the interface to pass into `@sodax/sdk`.** When bridging to the SDK, narrow with `useWalletProvider({ xChainId: ChainKeys.X })` (React) or just construct the provider directly and pass it in the SDK call payload (`{ raw: false, walletProvider }`).

### Top traps to avoid (integration)

1. **Mixing the two config variants.** `PRIVATE_KEY` and `BROWSER_EXTENSION` are mutually exclusive. Each chain's `*WalletProviderConfig` is a discriminated union — TypeScript catches mixing, but only if you don't use `as`.
2. **Adding viem / `@mysten/sui` / `@solana/web3.js` as a direct dep** when the type was importable from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`. See `integration/recipes/library-exports.md`.
3. **Deep-importing `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/EvmWalletProvider`**. v1's flat layout is gone; use barrel imports.
4. **Expecting `defaults` to deep-merge.** It doesn't — top-level keys overwrite wholesale.
5. **Trying to extend `BaseWalletProvider` directly** in consumer code. That's a maintainer-only path — write a thin wrapper over an existing provider instead.

### Verification (integration)

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit   # must exit clean
```

If errors mention `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`, look up the symbol in `integration/knowledge/reference/`. If the symbol isn't there, stop and ask the user — don't invent classes.

## Migration mode (v1 → v2 porting)

Pick this mode ONLY if you see one of these patterns:

- Deep imports: `import { … } from '@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/EvmWalletProvider'` (or similar per-chain file).
- Bumping `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` from an older RC and wanting to adopt new additive features (`defaults`, `*WalletDefaults`, `*Policy` types).

The package name **did not change** across versions. Class names, config-type names, and config shapes are **identical** v1 → v2. **No mandatory edits** at the wallet-sdk-core surface — v1 code drops in unchanged.

If a project does more than the deep-import cleanup at this surface, the real migration target is almost certainly `@sodax/sdk` (chain-key renames, Result<T>, error model) or `@sodax/types`. Route to the `sodax-sdk` skill (migration mode) instead.

### Workflow

1. Read [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DON'T + workflow. **The headline: v1 code drops in unchanged.**
2. Read [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/README.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/README.md) — what (additively) changed, read order, TL;DR.
3. Read the breaking-change writeups under [`breaking-changes/`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/breaking-changes/) — `folder-layout.md` (deep-import → barrel), `defaults-config.md`, `base-wallet-provider.md`, `library-exports.md`.
4. For mechanical changes, apply the recipes in [`recipes/`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/recipes/) — `adopt-defaults.md`, `adopt-library-exports.md`. **Both are optional** — they're cleanup paths, not requirements.
5. Confirm no renames / deletions exist by checking [`reference/`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/reference/) — `renamed-symbols.md` (empty), `deleted-exports.md` (empty), `added-fields.md` (additive new surface).
6. Verify with [`checklist.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/checklist.md).

### Top mechanical changes

1. **Deep imports → barrel imports.** Replace `import { EvmWalletProvider } from '@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/EvmWalletProvider'` with `import { EvmWalletProvider } from '@sodax/wallet-sdk-core'`. The flat `wallet-providers/*.ts` layout is gone.
2. **(Optional) Re-import chain SDK types from the barrel.** Replace direct imports of `WalletClient` (viem), `SuiClient` (@mysten/sui), etc. with re-exports from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`. Removes the underlying SDK as a direct dep, eliminates version skew. See `recipes/adopt-library-exports.md`.
3. **(Optional) Adopt `defaults` field.** New `defaults` (shallow-merge) field on each provider's config lets you set per-method overrides centrally. See `recipes/adopt-defaults.md`.

### Top traps to avoid (migration)

1. **Treating this as a real migration.** It isn't — v1 code drops in unchanged at the wallet-sdk-core surface. If the consumer's compile errors point at this package, look one layer deeper — they're almost certainly `@sodax/types` renames bleeding through (e.g. `xChainId` → `chainKey`) and the real fix is in the `sodax-sdk` skill (migration mode).
2. **Extending `BaseWalletProvider` in consumer code.** That's a maintainer path. If a project subclasses it, scope confirmation with the user before touching anything.

### Stop conditions (defer to user)

| Signal | Why stop |
|---|---|
| Compile errors mention `@sodax/sdk` or `@sodax/types` symbols | Not this migration. Route to `sodax-sdk` skill (migration mode). |
| Project extends `BaseWalletProvider` with non-trivial logic | Maintainer-only path. Confirm scope first. |
| User wants a chain family not in `integration/knowledge/reference/chain-support.md` | Adding a new chain is a maintainer task. |

### Verification (migration)

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit   # must exit clean
# No leftover deep imports from v1's flat layout:
grep -rE "from '@sodax/wallet-sdk-core/wallet-providers/" src/   # empty
```
